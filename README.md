# Expo Camera Asynchronous Permission Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API. The error is related to permissions and asynchronous operations, often resulting in unexpected behavior or crashes.  The solution involves carefully handling asynchronous operations and ensuring correct permission requests.

## Bug Report
The original `cameraBug.js` file contains code that demonstrates the problematic behavior. The error occurs because the permission request and camera initialization are not properly handled asynchronously. This can lead to race conditions and errors.

## Solution
The solution in `cameraBugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that addresses the asynchronous issues.  It uses promises and `async/await` to ensure that permissions are granted before attempting to access the camera.
